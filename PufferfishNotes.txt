You must have paper's per-player-mob-spawns setting set to true for this to work. One quick note - this does not actually spawn mobs async (that would be very unsafe). This just offloads some expensive calculations that are required for mob spawning." - Description request Kevin_

DAB Settings in the config:  (please review the airplane blog for a more detailed understanding)
  # Optimizes entity brains when

---------- Various Config Details Below ----------------

FLARE Settings:
  If you are a hosting client of Pufferfish.host, flare is part of your account options.
    The settings are:
       1. Set the flare URL to: flare.pufferfish.host
       2. Set the token to: pufferfish
     You can refer to these instructions or any updated instructions at:  https://flare.pufferfish.host/ 
     ** Access is granted only to internal PUFFERFISH HOST IP **
   
   NOT A PUFFERFISH HOST CLIENT
     If you are NOT a hosting client of Pufferfish you will currently need to become a Patreon of the Airplane project to access their flare tool.
     If you are not using the Oracle JDK you need two flags: -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints
     Airplane subscription and info is at: https://blog.airplane.gg/flare-tutorial/
   
   IN PROGRESS
     The ARC project is in progress and associated with PurpurMC - Currently unavailable for access: Bribe omega24 

   Flare only has one command:   /flare
     There is no "help" despite the command line saying so.



RELOAD Command: (Reload is generally NOT recommended on production servers)
    Usage: /pufferfish reload 
    Reload FAQ:
          Like can I turn DAB on and off with reload ?
          You can adjust DAB with a reload, yes (Quoted from Kevin_, Jan 13 2022, Purpur Discord Server) 
    Reload reestrictions/notes:
           Some things don't work with a reload, particularly sentry and the async mob spawns patch. (Quoted from Kevin_, Jan 13 2022, Purpur Discord Server) 
           


DAB Notes:           
DEAR Notes (LOE condensed interpretation in case the Airplane blog is hard to find):
  DEAR stands for: Dynamic Entity Activation Range ** DEAR was renamed to DAB: Dynamic Activation Brain
  ** DEAR is based on the player being the center of the settings (as it is with most mob and chunk based server handling). **
  
  This covers two different types of aspects due to the change in mob entities by Mojang; Pathfinder goals and mob AI or the "behaviour engine".
  The two examples given by Airplane (https://blog.airplane.gg/dear-configuration/ , Jan 14 2022) are: 
         - An example of how this works is a goal that Blazes have, where they look for a nearby player to target. 
         - If they are far away from a player, they won’t check as often for nearby players, which results in a 
         - huge performance improvement for blazes!
         
         - Paper’s current implementation of this is hard-coded to the activation range. If you have an activation 
         - range of 100 blocks, any simple entity further than 100 blocks to a player will only have their pathfinder 
         - goals ticked 1 of 4 times. Their implementation doesn’t impact other entities like Villagers or Piglins, 
         - while also being unable to optimize entities variably.
  
    These examples are important to understand, so I have directly quoted them. 
    ** Paper's activation range settings are still in effect and can/may alter how DEAR functions if the value is near or less than the Pufferfish.yml setting. (When I wrote this I do not know if PaperMC's settings can be disabled, nor if that would be advisable for many servers LOE)
    
    With DEAR you are setting how often the Entities are ticked, with further out entities much less often and closer in more often (this is the common usage).
    
    [activation-range]
      max-tick-freq = 20
      activation-dist-mod = 8     (example of how this works is easier with a compatible bit number)
      
           If you would like entities further away to tick less often, try lowering the value to 8. 
           Blocks Away from Player	Ticking Frequency   Real Time at 20 Ticks/Second (~ when the event happens)
                  16 or less	             1/1                    1  second
                  22	                     1/2                    2  seconds
                  27	                     1/3                    3  seconds
                  32	                     1/4                    4  seconds
                  45	                     1/8                    8  seconds
                  64	                     1/16                   16 seconds
                  71 or more	             1/20                   20 seconds
         As opposed to PaperMC's default behaviour for Out Of Range Entities every 4 seconds (at 20 ticks / second), and In Range Entities every 2 seconds.
         
         For these two settings: 
             activation-dist-mod - Activation range minimum bit distance, beyond this is handled by the last ticking frequency. (bit shift value for the block distance)  
             
             max-tick-freq - This is the ticking frequency setting. ** Note in the table above this is the 1/20 at the maximum range **
      
        Per Kevin_ of Pufferfish: 
           "My recommendation for that setting is not to decrease it below 7" - In reference to: activation-dist-mod
           "Servers that are really bad might see benefit going to 6, but going lower than 6 will likely see no performance improvement at all."
    
           "If you want it to behave exactly like paper, just disable it." 
           "If you have farms, I’d recommend either disabling the entire feature, adding the entity to the blocked entities list, or reducing max tick freq to around 4."

BlackListed Entities:
  # A list of entities to ignore for activation
  blacklisted-entities: []
  
  This setting requires the removal of the square brackets and a negative entitiy assignment on a new line:
  Example:   blacklisted-entities: 
                   - ENDERMAN
                   - VILLAGER
